Welcome to my blog! This blog is created as an assignment of my fresher training program at VNG. I want to create a blog like this for a long time, but I'm still hesitating. Thanks to VNG Tech Fresher traning program, I finally have a blog for myself :D. From now on, I will share the technical knowledge that I have learned as well as stories in my life on this blog. Hope this blog helps someone!
