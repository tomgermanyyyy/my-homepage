      <description>Hello everyone, this is my first blog. Today we will have a discussion on System Design.
Introduction In this era, writing blog is very popular, especially for software developers. They can write blog to get deeper understanding about a concept, a problem, or a technology as well as improve their writing skill and share knowledge to people.
Write a blog for just yourself or a few people to read is easy, but when the number of users scale up, the transactions per second (tps) may increase rapidly, how can your system handle this situation?</description>
