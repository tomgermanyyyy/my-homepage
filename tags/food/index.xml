It can be as simple as a splash of milk in a hot cup of tea, or it can be a complex recipe including various ingredients, like the popular bubble tea. Adding milk mellows and smooths out the flavors of tea, particularly some of the bitter notes found in black tea. Milk tea is enjoyed throughout the world as both a hot and cold beverage.</description></item></channel></rss>
